This is a very simple machine learning project that uses simple Linear Regression model to predict a Red wine's Quality on a scale of 1-10.


Dataset used: winequality-red.csv

Dataset source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

filename_train.ipynb   => This file trains a linear regression model and saves .pkl model file. 

filename_model.ipynb   => This file tests different values for wine features by loading the saved .pkl model file. 

-> Used Jupyter notebook , Scikit-Learn , pickle , pandas.
